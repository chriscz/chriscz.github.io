        <p>There has been one thing that has carried me through these
last few months, and has prevented a relapse to my morning 
depression - routine.</p>
<p>I used to wake up every morning and reflect on the 
many ways that my life has not succeeded and all the
ways the I am still inferior. These thoughts are pretty automatic,
and there isn't much you can do to stop them from a pure will
perspective. So I tried some apps, the first was one that I had
used a few years prior which helped me start a morning routine:
Fabulous, developed by a <a href="http://advanced-hindsight.com/">team at Duke University</a> under the
lead of behavioural economist Dan Ariely which you might remember
from this famous <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions">Ted talk on the Economist subscription model</a>.</p>
<p>Back then it was useful, right now I didn't even want to get out of bed.
I HAD to make a plan. I set out to use my alarm app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&amp;hl=en">Sleep as Android</a>,
and looked at what it had to offer in terms of getting up. </p>
<p>I had used the captcha solving before, but now needed a stronger dose
of force: The QR Scanner. This scanner supports normal
barcodes, so I set it up to a coffee tin in my kitchen.
Caption: The coffee tin of redemption.</p>
<p>The first week was especially hard, and
I knew that I had to chain several simple habits together, so I added the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>drink a glass of lemon water while in the kitchen, </li>
<li>go back to your room and do some push-ups -- 12 at the least --, </li>
<li>take a shower,</li>
<li>then meditate.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll admit; some days I fucked up as I went out the night before, and 
instead of completing the routine, I would get back in bed and sleep
a few more hours.</p>
<p>However, in the last 3-4 weeks this has proven to be the most significant change
I've made this year. It has allowed me to do some of the things I 
would usually have to rush, such as my meditation. It 
just makes for a better overall day.</p>
<p>I have now adapted my routine to include some morning contemplations:
Reading Marcus Aurelius's Meditations, and reflecting on 
questions that I have typed for myself.</p>
