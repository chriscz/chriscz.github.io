Not how to continue the perpetual resent, but instead the

&lt;p&gt;If it was useful to you, 
the lesson will in due course become clear, remembered, 
and at best this mistake is never repeated again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it was useful to others they may not know it at first,
but however it may be that you are either hated, reviled or 
silently judged so be their lesson and your reward. 
Try reasonably to correct a wrong understanding, 
apologize sincerely or say nothing if needed. 
Be skillful, but don't resent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="musing"></category><category term="guilt"></category><category term="mistakes"></category><category term="resent"></category><category term="opportunity"></category></entry><entry><title>Origins</title><link href="https://chriscz.github.io/origins.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-04T21:52:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-09-04T21:52:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Chris</name></author><id>tag:chriscz.github.io,2017-09-04:/origins.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Funny.

&lt;p&gt;The more the momental acceptance becomes a part of you,&lt;br&gt;

Sometimes you must speak -- explain if you will.&lt;br&gt;
And so you do your best to paint a causal back story,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we even able to understand the origin of&lt;br&gt;
