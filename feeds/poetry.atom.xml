Be the young one,&lt;br&gt;
the curious heart&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you say that you know&lt;br&gt;
where your path in life &lt;br&gt;
will have you go&lt;br&gt;
and if it does,&lt;br&gt;
as you please,&lt;br&gt;
then tell me truly did it appease?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if when you least expect&lt;br&gt;
a storm creeps right to your shore.&lt;br&gt;
Your wit and smarts matched against&lt;br&gt;
its rolling  roar.&lt;br&gt;
Admit the truth and let it be:&lt;br&gt;
your plans now cast in uncertainty  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus I say, friend or foe:&lt;br&gt;
hold on to life, but not too tight.&lt;br&gt;
Hold it gently like a hatchling owl&lt;br&gt;
keeping enough space for it to breathe.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as you tense your grip on life&lt;br&gt;
you only haul the noose &lt;br&gt;
around your neck.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poetry"></category></entry><entry><title>Sunset rise</title><link href="https://chriscz.github.io/sunset-rise.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-10T18:41:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-07-10T18:41:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Chris</name></author><id>tag:chriscz.github.io,2017-07-10:/sunset-rise.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You are the moment of the peeking sun:&lt;br&gt;

an obstacle to overcome.&lt;br&gt;

each belief - a biased drive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It keeps to seem that the words of others carry sense more than my own.&lt;br&gt;

roaring past as you watch&lt;br&gt;
with a feeling in heart&lt;br&gt;
that words can't touch.&lt;br&gt;
Seeing its gracefully violent nature&lt;br&gt;
as the answer&lt;br&gt;

itself.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poetry"></category></entry><entry><title>Lone</title><link href="https://chriscz.github.io/lone.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-23T20:08:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-05-23T20:08:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Chris</name></author><id>tag:chriscz.github.io,2017-05-23:/lone.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On levels impossible I try to relate,&lt;br&gt;
