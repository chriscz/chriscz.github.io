speaks to me tonight.&lt;br&gt;
The sun's last caress of the mountain's cheek,&lt;br&gt;
Red pink purple -- gone.&lt;br&gt;
Rustling leaves - the last protest.&lt;br&gt;
Moments - these, my happiness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speak wind. I will hear your&lt;br&gt;

foreign man or beast&lt;br&gt;
which strayed past his home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lay to rest your qualms, your dissatisfaction.&lt;br&gt;
Let be the moment you're in.&lt;br&gt;
Be with it: fears, tears, love and sin.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poetry"></category></entry><entry><title>Musings on Ignorance</title><link href="https://chriscz.github.io/musings-on-ignorance.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-11T12:06:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-05-11T12:06:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Chris</name></author><id>tag:chriscz.github.io,2017-05-11:/musings-on-ignorance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;And as we consume our meals of ignorance: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack,

we deny their existence even as we peek the shadow of that gnawing feeling they create. 
We say aloud in our mind, as if to drown that feeling: 
"It's ok, it isn't what it really is, this is an exception to the rule, the rational rule. Calm, don't fret, it's but one transgression". 
And thus one becomes many, finally we find ourselves in the present filled with regret, asking how it all happened. 
It's obvious how it happened, but probably not to you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="musing"></category></entry><entry><title>November</title><link href="https://chriscz.github.io/november.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-18T09:10:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-04-18T09:10:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Chris</name></author><id>tag:chriscz.github.io,2017-04-18:/november.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello November, you caught me by surprise.  &lt;/p&gt;
